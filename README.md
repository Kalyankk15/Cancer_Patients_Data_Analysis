# 📊 Cancer Patients Data Analysis (2015–2024)

## 🔬 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of **50,000 cancer patients** from various countries between **2015 and 2024**. It explores trends in cancer types, survival rates, treatment costs, stages, and patient demographics using Python and powerful visualization libraries.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes the following fields:
- `Patient_ID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Country_Region`
- `Year`
- `Cancer_Type`
- `Cancer_Stage`
- `Survival_Years`
- `Treatment_Cost_USD`
- `Target_Severity_Score`

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 Key Analyses & Visualizations
### 1. Gender Distribution of Cancer Patients
![Gender distribution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e689084-27ca-4705-a820-aeec6aa94cf5)

This pie chart shows the proportion of male and female cancer patients. It helps identify if certain cancers are gender-specific or disproportionately affect one gender more.

---

### 2. Age Distribution
![hist](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184c6c18-4c93-4d0e-a62e-f9291bbcb763)

The histogram shows the frequency of cancer cases across age ranges. It highlights the most vulnerable age groups and supports age-targeted prevention strategies.

Shows how treatment cost varies by cancer type and stage. Useful for policymakers and insurance firms to strategize resource allocation.

---

### 6. Survival Years by Cancer Stage
![avg survival rate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d7f2b7-1b68-443a-bf23-ebc2a9252f19)

This bar chart compares the average survival years across different stages, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention.

---

### 7. Yearly Trend of Average Treatment Cost
![avg treatment cost yearly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e453f24d-aa79-4ed4-9690-5cd1f83fa6bb)

This line chart tracks how treatment costs have changed from 2015 to 2024, indicating healthcare inflation trends.

### 8. Top 5 Countries by Average Treatment Cost
![t5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e6da82c-fb97-491b-afe3-ea18adc6087d)

Helps understand the economic burden of cancer treatment in different countries, guiding international health aid or budget policies.

---

### 9. Year-wise Patient Count
![yr](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae2186f-333c-4803-8bec-2861ae692dec)

Displays how cancer cases have increased or decreased over the years, helping understand growth trends and global risk.

## 📌 Insights
- Stage III was the most common stage at diagnosis.
- Treatment costs increased consistently from 2015 to 2024.
- Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers were the most prevalent.
- Countries like the US and Germany had higher treatment costs.
- Stage 0/I patients had significantly longer survival years.

## 🧠 Recommendations
- **Increase early detection programs** to catch cancer at Stages 0/I and improve survival rates.
- **Subsidize treatment costs** in high-burden countries and for high-cost cancers.
- **Raise awareness among younger adults**, especially in age groups showing rising trends.
- **Invest in gender-specific cancer research**, particularly for the most common types affecting women and men disproportionately.
- **Implement global partnerships** to support countries with growing patient numbers but limited resources.
